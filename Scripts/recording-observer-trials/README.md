To record a session for the Observer Trials:

* Load the desired simulation onto the Rust server (include forces & velocities).
* Play the Unity game. The box will be placed in front of the player when the server first connects, and you can 
  repeat this by pressing the space bar.
* Start the recording script in this version of nanover-protocol: https://github.com/IRL2/nanover-protocol/pull/291 
  with ``python C:\Users\rhosl\GIT_REPOS\nanover-protocol\python-libraries\nanover-omni\src\nanover\omni\record.py``
* Stop the script with ``ctrl + c``.
